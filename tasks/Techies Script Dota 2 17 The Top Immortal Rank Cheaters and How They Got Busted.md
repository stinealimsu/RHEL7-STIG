## What is Techies Script?
 
Techies script is a program that runs in the background while you play Dota 2 17. It can perform various actions for you based on your keyboard inputs and the game state. For example, it can:
 
- Place mines automatically on predefined locations or where you click.
- Detonate mines when an enemy hero is in range or when you press a hotkey.
- Hide your mines from enemy vision using fog of war or trees.
- Stack mines on top of each other to create powerful explosions.
- Use items such as Force Staff or Blink Dagger to escape or initiate.

Techies script can make playing Techies easier and more fun, as you don't have to worry about micromanaging your mines and traps. However, it also takes away some of the skill and creativity involved in playing Techies, as you rely on a program to do most of the work for you. Moreover, techies script can give you an unfair advantage over your opponents, who may not be able to counter your mines or detect your script.
