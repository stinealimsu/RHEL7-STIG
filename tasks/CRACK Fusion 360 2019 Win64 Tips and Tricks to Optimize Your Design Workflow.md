## How to Access the Flexible 3D Modeling and Design Features
 
Fusion 360 offers a variety of modeling and design tools that let you create anything from simple shapes to complex products. You can use direct, surface, parametric, mesh, or freeform modeling techniques depending on your needs and preferences. You can also import and export files in various formats such as STEP, IGES, STL, OBJ, DXF, DWG, etc.
 
To access the modeling and design features of Fusion 360, you need to create a new project or open an existing one. Then, you can use the toolbar at the top of the screen to select the tools you want to use. You can also use the browser on the left side of the screen to manage your components, bodies, sketches, constraints, etc.
 
Some of the modeling and design features of Fusion 360 include:

- Sketching: You can create 2D sketches using lines, arcs, circles, rectangles, polygons, splines, text, etc. You can also apply dimensions and constraints to define your sketch geometry.
- Modeling: You can create 3D models using extrude, revolve, sweep, loft, pipe, coil, etc. You can also modify your models using fillet, chamfer, shell, draft, split face, split body, etc.
- Surface: You can create surface models using patch, offset face, boundary fill, trim tool,
etc. You can also modify your surface models using extend face,
stitch,
unstitch,
sculpt,
etc.
- Mesh: You can create mesh models using primitives such as box,
sphere,
cylinder,
torus,
etc. You can also modify your mesh models using edit form,
reduce,
remesh,
smooth,
etc.
- Freeform: You can create freeform models using T-splines technology. You can manipulate control points,
edges,
and faces
to shape your model as you like.

## How to Produce High-Quality CNC Machined Parts and Additively Manufactured Builds
 
Fusion 360 integrates CAD and CAM capabilities in one platform. This means you can design your parts and generate toolpaths for CNC machining or additive manufacturing without switching between different software applications. You can also
