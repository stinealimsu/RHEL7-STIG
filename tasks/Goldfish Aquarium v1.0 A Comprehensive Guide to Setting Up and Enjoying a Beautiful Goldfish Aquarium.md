## How to Choose the Right Size and Type of Aquarium for Your Goldfish
  
One of the most common mistakes that beginners make when keeping goldfish is choosing a tank that is too small. Goldfish are not suitable for bowls or small tanks. They need a lot of space to swim and grow. They also produce a lot of waste that can quickly pollute a small tank.
  
A general rule of thumb is to provide at least 10 gallons of water per goldfish. However, this may vary depending on the type and size of your goldfish. Some varieties, such as fancy goldfish, can grow up to 8 inches long and may need more space. Others, such as comet or common goldfish, can grow up to 12 inches long and may need even more space.
  
The best type of aquarium for goldfish is a long and rectangular one. This will provide them with more surface area and oxygen. Avoid tall and narrow tanks that will limit their swimming space. You should also avoid tanks that have curved or distorted glass, as this can stress your goldfish and affect their vision.
  
## How to Cycle Your Tank and Prepare It for Your Goldfish
  
Before you add any fish to your tank, you need to cycle it first. Cycling is the process of establishing a beneficial bacteria colony in your filter and substrate that will break down the ammonia and nitrite produced by your fish. Ammonia and nitrite are toxic to fish and can cause them to get sick or die.
  
To cycle your tank, you need to add a source of ammonia to your tank and monitor the levels of ammonia, nitrite, and nitrate with a test kit. You can use fish food, pure ammonia, or a hardy fish as a source of ammonia. The cycle is complete when the ammonia and nitrite levels drop to zero and the nitrate level rises.

Cycling can take anywhere from 2 to 8 weeks depending on the size of your tank, the temperature, the pH, and the amount of ammonia you add. You should not add any goldfish until the cycle is complete. You should also perform a large water change before adding your goldfish to lower the nitrate level.
