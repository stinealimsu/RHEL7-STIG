Customize only the parts of the Windows interface you want to change and SkinStudio will do the rest."[^1^]

> "The new version of SkinStudio is designed to make it much easier for new users to get into skinning. Skinners can change as much or little of the GUI as they choose and SkinStudio will fill in the rest for them. A new skin can take a matter of minutes or weeks depending on how sophisticated the skin is."[^2^]

However, some users have also reported some issues with downloading and installing the software. For example, one user said:

> "It is nearly impossible to download. At any rate I managed to find it on sourceforge but as a paying subscriber, I believe that qualifies me for skinstudio Pro, a shortcoming that my present version of skinstudio constantly reminds me of as it limits customization ability."[^3^]
