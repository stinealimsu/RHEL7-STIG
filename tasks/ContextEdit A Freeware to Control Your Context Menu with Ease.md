The context menu is the menu that appears when you right-click on a file, folder, or desktop in Windows. It offers you various actions you can perform with the item, such as opening, copying, deleting, renaming, and more. However, sometimes the context menu can get cluttered with too many entries from different programs that you install or uninstall. This can make it slow and hard to find the option you need.
 
Fortunately, there is a simple and handy tool that can help you edit your context menu items easily and safely. It is called ContextEdit[^1^], and it is a free software that lets you control which items are displayed on your context menu for different file types and extensions. You can add, remove, edit, or disable any context menu entry with just a few clicks. You can also view the shell commands and handlers associated with each entry and tweak them as you wish.
